# Various-tasks-in-R

This repository contains various exercises performed in R. They almost exclusively consider problems of probability theory or statistics. The tasks are written in .Rmd files with R codes in them. I also added corresponding PDF files (aforementioned .Rmd files printed into PDF with MikTeX). More detailed descriptions of considered issues are supplied in each catalogue's README file, a catalogue name corresponds to the name of the course I attended. Only the "Statistical learning" tasks are fully in English, all remaining are done in Polish.

1. Foundations of practical statistics (Podstawy statystyki praktycznej)
2. Linear models (Modele liniowe)
3. Advanced linear models (Zaawansowane modele liniowe)
4. Analysis of large data sets (Analiza dużych zbiorów danych)
5. Statistical learning
