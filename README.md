# Various-tasks-in-R

This repository contains various tasks performed in R. They almost exclusively consider problems of probability theory or statistics. The tasks are wrapped in .Rmd files with R codes in them. I also added corresponding PDF files, which are just .Rmd files printed into PDF with MikTeX. More detailed descriptions of considered issues are written in each catalogue's README file, a catalogue name corresponds to the name of the course I attended. Only the "Statistical learning" tasks are fully in english, all other are done in polish.
