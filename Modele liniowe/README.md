- two dimensional normal distribution
- affine transformation of multinomial normal distribution
- correlation plots
- correlation between coefficients of random vector
- linear regression:
1. estimators of regression coefficients
2. testing hypothesis about single and multiple regression coefficients
3. confidence intervals for expected value and new observation
4. distribution of estimator of regression coefficient
- power function of statistical test
- critical value and p-value of statistical test
- ANOVA
- analysis of residuals for linear regression
- QQ plots 
- confusion matrix
